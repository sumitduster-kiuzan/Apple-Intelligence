/var/db/eligibilityd/eligibility.plist
you will find this file, make a copy of it, modify it identical to my screen (for greymatter basically: 1,4,3,3,3,3 as on the screen)
Save, do command+i on the file, click lock
Replace the old one with this one
That's it.. WITHOUT TOUCHING YOUR MAC SETTINGS, whether it's the region, the language and so on. You will be in the Apple Intelligence waiting list in Sequoia 15.1 beta 4
